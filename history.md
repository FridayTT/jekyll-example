The story of Maris Tower begins more than seven centuries ago, when coastal merchants and fishermen needed a beacon to guide them safely back to the harbor. Constructed from pale stone quarried in the nearby cliffs, **the tower first served as a lighthouse**, its fires visible for miles across the sea.

Over time, the tower became more than a practical structure. Ancient myths grew around it—tales of a guardian spirit who lived within its walls and calmed the waters for sailors in need. Some legends even say that the tower was built upon the ruins of an older temple dedicated to the sea gods.

*In the 15th century*, Maris Tower was expanded by local rulers, who added defensive walls and lookout points. It became not only a guide for ships but also a symbol of protection for the city itself. During the golden age of maritime trade, caravans of goods passed through the harbor, and the tower stood as the first sight welcoming travelers from distant lands.

Today, though modern lights and technology have replaced its original fires, Maris Tower remains a living monument. It is a reminder of the city’s deep connection to the sea and its people’s enduring relationship with waves, winds, and legends.
