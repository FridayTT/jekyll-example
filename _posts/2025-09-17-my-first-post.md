This fall, Maris Tower will host its first annual “Festival of the Waves,” a unique event celebrating the region’s deep connection with the sea. 
The festival will feature traditional music performances, boat parades along the harbor, and storytelling sessions about the mythical guardians of the tower.
Visitors can also enjoy open-air food stalls serving freshly prepared seafood dishes and local delicacies. With lights illuminating the tower against the evening sky, the Festival of the Waves promises to be a magical experience for all.
